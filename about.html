    <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
    <p>The Fat Duck is a fine dining restaurant in Bray, Berkshire, England. It is run by celebrity chef proprietor
        Heston Blumenthal. Housed in a 16th-century building that had previously been the site of the Bell pub, the Fat
        Duck opened on 16 August 1995. Although it originally served food similar to that of a French bistro, it soon
        acquired a reputation for precision and invention, and has been at the forefront of many modern culinary
        developments, such as food pairing, flavour encapsulation and multi-sensory cooking.
        The number of staff in the kitchen has increased from four when it first opened to 42, resulting in a ratio of
        one kitchen staff member per customer. The restaurant gained its first Michelin star in 1999, its second in 2002
        and its third in 2004, making it one of eight in the United Kingdom to earn three Michelin stars. It lost its
        status as a three-starred restaurant in the 2016 guide due to renovation preventing it from being open for
        assessment. The restaurant regained three stars in the following year's Michelin guide.
        The restaurant is known for its fourteen-course tasting menu featuring dishes such as nitro-scrambled egg and
        bacon ice cream, an Alice in Wonderland-inspired mock turtle soup involving a bouillon packet made up to look
        like a fob watch dissolved in tea, and a dish called Sound of the Sea which includes an audio element. The
        restaurant has an associated laboratory where Blumenthal and his team develop new dish concepts.
        In 2009, the restaurant suffered from the largest norovirus outbreak ever documented at a restaurant with
        over 400 diners falling ill.

    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p>The Fat Duck is located in a 16th-century cottage that was further modified in the 19th and 20th centuries. Prior
        to the restaurant opening in the location, it was a public house called the Ringers. The building was Grade II
        listed by English Heritage on 2 May 1989. When the restaurant opened in 1995, the kitchen was staffed by
        owner Heston Blumenthal and one other employee. At the time the restaurant was serving meals in the style of a
        French bistro, such as lemon tarts, and steak and chips. Blumenthal later said that science had already begun to
        influence the cooking at this early stage, as already on the menu were his triple-cooked chips, which were
        developed to stop the potato from going soft.</p>
    <h2 id="menu">Menu</h2>
    <p>
        Blumenthal was inspired as a teenager by trips to the Michelin-starred restaurants in France and the work of
        Harold McGee. McGee's work in particular led him to question traditional cooking techniques and approaches which
        resulted in combinations which may at first appear unusual.[13] Blumenthal incorporates psychology and the
        perception of diners into his dishes, explaining, "For example, eat sardine on toast sorbet for the first time,
        confusion will reign as the brain will be trying to tell the palate to expect a dessert and you will therefore
        be tasting more sweetness than actually exists."[14] The restaurant serves a fourteen-course tasting menu.[15]

        Dishes served include palate cleansers made of vodka and green tea, frozen in liquid nitrogen, a snail
        porridge that was described by one food critic as "infamous", and ice creams of both crab, and egg and bacon,
        each of which resulted in increased media attention for the restaurant. The mock turtle soup has an Alice in
        Wonderland theme, where a fob watch formed of freeze-dried beef stock covered with gold leaf is dropped into a
        tea cup by a waiter, who pours a beef stock "tea" poured over it that dissolves the gold and the watch. A plate
        of ox tongue and vegetables is served alongside it to place into the soup. Toast sandwiches are served as a side
        dish. It had been developed for an appearance on Heston's Feasts, and was afterwards added to the menu
        at the restaurant. Dishes are served with additional sensory inputs, such as "Sounds of the Sea", a plate of
        seafood served with a seafood foam on top of a "beach" of tapioca, breadcrumbs and eel. Alongside the dish,
        diners are given an iPod to listen to crashing waves whilst they eat. Other additional sensory components
        include "the smell of the Black Forest" that accompanies a kirsch ice cream.

    <h2 id="food_scare">Food scare, closure, and reopening</h2>
    <p>On 27 February 2009, Blumenthal closed his restaurant temporarily after a number of customers reported feeling
        unwell at different times. By 3 March the source of the outbreak was still unclear but sabotage had been
        ruled out. A spokesman for the restaurant said "All this leads us to believe that it [the health scare] has not
        come from the restaurant and we expect to be given the all clear." On 6 March it was reported that 400
        people had stated they had felt unwell after eating at the restaurant.

        The restaurant reopened on 12 March 2009. The cause of the illness was later given by the Health Protection
        Agency as norovirus, which was thought to originate from oysters which had been harvested from beds contaminated
        with sewage. The virus was spread further after being contracted by staff members. The restaurant was
        criticised for its cleaning methods and its slow response to the incident. Complaints of illness from
        customers totalled 529.

        The Fat Duck had received negative publicity regarding health standards before, when food and safety officers in
        2004 found "borderline" levels of listeria in the foie gras and expressed concern that "no core temperatures of
        the meat are taken".</p>
